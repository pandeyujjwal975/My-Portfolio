### Ujjwal Pandey — Cybersecurity Portfolio ###

This repository contains my personal cybersecurity portfolio website. It represents my learning journey across **cybersecurity fundamentals**, **frontend development**, and **automation thinking**, presented through a clean, hacker-style interface inspired by terminal workflows and minimal system design.

The live portfolio is available here →  
🔗 https://pandeyujjwal975.github.io/

The website is built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **vanilla JavaScript**, following a simple and maintainable structure. It integrates practical tools such as **Git & GitHub** for version control, **EmailJS** for the contact system, and **LocalStorage** for data persistence in projects. My cybersecurity learning foundation includes **Linux basics**, **networking fundamentals**, and **introductory web security concepts**, supported by hands-on tools like **Termux** and **SPCK**.

The portfolio showcases real, usable projects rather than demos. These include a **GPA Calculator** for students, a **Weekly Planner** for productivity and task management, and this **personal portfolio** itself. Both the GPA Calculator and Weekly Planner are fully functional web applications that use LocalStorage to retain user data.

The codebase is intentionally minimal and readable, primarily consisting of `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, and supporting assets. This portfolio will continue to evolve with future improvements such as theme persistence, performance optimization, accessibility enhancements, and security-focused mini case studies.
